In responsive web design, breakpoints are specific points or ranges
of viewport widths at which the layout and design of a webpage adapt
to provide an optimal user experience. Breakpoints are defined based
on common device sizes or the specific needs of the website.

The purpose of breakpoints is to ensure that a webpage's
content and design elements are displayed in a readable and visually pleasing
manner across various devices, such as desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
By using breakpoints, you can apply different CSS rules and modify the layout
and styling of your webpage at specific viewport widths.

/* Default styles for all screen sizes */

/* Styles for screens up to 600px */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens up to 600px */
}

/* Styles for screens between 601px and 900px */
@media screen and (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 900px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens between 601px and 900px */
}

/* Styles for screens above 900px */
@media screen and (min-width: 901px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens above 900px */
}
