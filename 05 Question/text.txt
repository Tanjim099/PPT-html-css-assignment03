The orientation media feature in CSS is used to target the orientation
of a device's viewport, whether it is in portrait or landscape mode.
It allows you to apply specific styles or adjust the layout of your
webpage based on the orientation of the device.

The purpose of the orientation media feature is to ensure that your
webpage's design and content are optimized for different orientations,
providing an enhanced user experience. By applying different styles
based on the orientation, you can make sure that your webpage looks and
functions well regardless of how the user is holding their device.

Here's an example of how the orientation media feature can be used in a media query:

/* Styles for devices in portrait orientation */
@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
  /* CSS rules for portrait orientation */
}

/* Styles for devices in landscape orientation */
@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  /* CSS rules for landscape orientation */
}
