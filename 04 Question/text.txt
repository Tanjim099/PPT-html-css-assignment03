Media queries for print media are specifically designed to target the printing output
of web content, allowing you to apply customized styles and formatting specifically
for print purposes. The purpose of using media queries for print media is to optimize
the printed version of your webpage, ensuring that it is well-formatted, legible,
and visually appealing when users choose to print it.

When users decide to print a webpage, the default styles and layout that
are suitable for screen display may not translate well to the printed page.
Text may be too small, background colors may be unnecessary, and certain elements
might not make sense in a print context. Media queries for print media address
these concerns by providing the ability to override or modify the default
styles for printing.
