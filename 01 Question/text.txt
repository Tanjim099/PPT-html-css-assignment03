Q. What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose?
A. A media query in CSS is a feature that allows you to apply different styles
to a webpage based on certain conditions, such as the characteristics
of the device or the viewport size. It enables you to create responsive
designs that adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and media types.

The purpose of media queries is to make your website or application
look and function optimally across various devices and platforms.
With media queries, you can define specific CSS rules that will
be applied when the specified conditions are met. This allows you
to customize the layout, typography, colors, and other design elements
based on the device's capabilities and screen dimensions.

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels */
  /* Adjust layout, font sizes, etc. for smaller screens */
}
