In CSS, a media query is a feature that allows you to apply different styles to a
webpage based on certain conditions or characteristics of the user's device or viewport.
Media queries are commonly used for creating responsive web designs that adapt
to different screen sizes, orientations, and other device-specific features.

To define a media query in CSS, you use the @media rule followed by the
specific conditions or features you want to target. Here's the basic syntax:

@media media-type and (condition) {
  /* CSS rules for the specified conditions */
}
